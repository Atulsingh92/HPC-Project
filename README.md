# HPC-Project
The project was to understand the basics of Matrix multiplication using OpenMP constructs.
The five tasks are as 
1) Matrix multiplication using both sequential and Parallel computing(OpenMP) Methods
2) Matrix multiplication and Summation using both sequential and Parallel computing(OpenMP) Methods
3) Random number generator - Fill a n√óm matrix with uniformly distributed random numbers using both sequential and OpenMP.
4) Filling a larger matrix with random numbers both sequentially and  parallely and creating heatmap of the generated matrix using R.
5) Comparing time taken by Large matrix computation (AB+c) between Sequential and Parallel operations.
